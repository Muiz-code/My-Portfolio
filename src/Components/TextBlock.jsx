          Hi, I'm Muiz Owolabi Ayodeji. I'm a multi-talented human with over 2+
          years of experiences in Frontend development.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a Frontend Developer, I have over 2.5 years of experience in
          creating innovative and user-friendly web interfaces using React.js,
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind,
          Google ui. I have also acquired skills in SASS, Aos and GreenSock
          Animation Platform (GSAP) to enhance the visual appeal and
          interactivity of web pages. I have worked on multiple projects for
          clients and also have interned in Lotus Beta Analytics, where I
          matched content to customer specifications, evaluated new
          technologies, and produced high-quality, clean code.
          <br />
          <br />
          My education background in Computer Science at Kwara State University
          has equipped me with a strong technical foundation and a passion for
          lifelong learning. I am currently pursuing a Frontend Developer
          Certificate at Malhub, where I am expanding my knowledge and skills in
          frontend development. I value user-centered design, problem-solving,
          and collaboration, and I strive to deliver web solutions that meet the
          needs and expectations of both users and stakeholders. I am eager to
          apply my talents and experience to new challenges and opportunities in
          the frontend development field.
